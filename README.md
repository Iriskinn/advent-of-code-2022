My solutions to some problems from https://adventofcode.com/2022.

By default `%DAY_NUMBER%/A.*` is a solution for the Part One, `%DAY_NUMBER%/B.*` is a solution for the Part Two. Sometimes `input.txt` is slightly modified in order to make it more readable for the program (for example, removing empty line at the end of the input file or adding a number of lines/blocks at the beginning).
